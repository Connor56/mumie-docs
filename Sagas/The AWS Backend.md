This saga is going to be a combination of creating things for Mumie and learning all about the tech stack we use at Koroutine. The tools I'm going to use are the same as those used by our team internally:

1. GRPC Connect for protobuf communication: https://connectrpc.com/
2. redis for caching: https://redis.io/
3. lambda for functions: https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/
4. maybe at some point kubernetes k8s: https://kubernetes.io/
5. flutter for the application: https://flutter.dev/
6. firebase for the user data: https://firebase.google.com/docs
7. Ent for the ORM connections: https://entgo.io/
8. CDK for deployment: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/home.html
9. In the end, I may need to go for Terraform for Deployment (closer to what we do at Koroutine): https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials
10. Atlas for controlling database migrations: https://atlasgo.io/getting-started
