## 21:16 - Designing the flutter app
- Got the new Android Studio and accompanying SDK downloaded.

## 21:40 - Hyper V
- The emulation I'm doing is so fucking slow, it's painful. I'm trying my best to get hyper v or something so it's not so shit.
- Apparently Hyper-V can make this faster. I'm also going to try and connect my real device.
- Hell I'm going to do both and then see which is better.
- First my actual device, which I'm downloading a driver for now.

## 22:01 - Managed to get my device to let me debug!
- Hell yeah baby!
- The issue was with USB debugging, it was switched on but the prompt to allow my windows machine to have control hadn't come up. #issue
- I switched USB debugging on and off again and hey presto, the question came up and allowed me to say yes! #fix-found 
- Now the option to use the phone is available.
- Now I just need to get the app to run on the phone!
- I'll call it a day if I can do that.

## 22:19 - Gradle being a bitch
- I've been seeing this from Gradle: #issue

```
- Which is telling me to upgrade gradle after checking my flutter version of Java Development Kit.
- Looks like I'm using OpenJDK 21, so I need gradle 8.5 plus, I've installed 8.8, let's see if it works.

## 22:25 - Still couldn't get Gradle to compile and build
- It takes forever for this piece of shit to compile and build.
- Perhaps that's to do with me doing it on my phone though?
- I'll try hypervisor tomorrow and see if that works instead.

## 22:40 - Upgraded flutter now
- see if that works with gradle when building a completely empty project.
- Once upgraded it all worked fine, LFG!!!
- Leaving it now, come back tomorrow.
