## 8:02 - Still working on emails
- The emails still aren't working correctly after last night, which is a bit annoying. But I'm slowly learning about postfix and how it works.
- This is a decent story on setting up WordPress and postfix, although nowhere near as good as mine will be: https://www.tecmint.com/install-wordpress-lamp-postfix-mail-notifications-vps-server/
- This is another story with content on how to setup the postfix and Amazon SES connection: https://www.cloudpanel.io/tutorial/how-to-configure-amazon-ses-with-postfix/
- This is an interesting post as well: https://serverfault.com/questions/291574/postfix-and-amazon-ses-forwarding-emails-problem-with-delivered-to-header
- I checked if the `sendmail` service was installed with the following:
```sh
sudo systemctl status sendmail
```
- This looks like a really good article with a bit more detail on what the various bits that help you send the email are, not just how to do it: https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/how-to-configure-aws-ses-with-postfix-mta/
- This is an article by postfix on SASL: https://www.postfix.org/SASL_README.html
- Here's another article on setting up postfix to use your actual domain name so the email isn't rejected by Amazon SES: https://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/howto-postfix-masquerade-change-email-mail-address.html
- Okay, so now I'm installing a SASL package called cyrus:
```sh
sudo dnf install cyrus-sasl-plain
```
- It turned out it was already installed though, how strange! I guess postfix might have installed it?
- So now apparently I have to configure my postfix to use the address of my Amazon SES location, which means setting the following variable:
```sh
# MY VARIABLES
#
# Below are user variables for the configuration.
SES_MTA="email-smtp.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com"
```
- I added this in its own new section. Hence all the commented gubbins above.
- Now they want me to use a `postconf` command which I guess is a quick way of altering the postfix file?
- Before doing this I made a copy of the `main.cf` file, saving it as `main.cf.old`.
- Yes `postconf` if a command line utility for interacting with the main.cf file of postfix. Anyway, they want me to use this command:
```sh
sudo postconf -e "relayhost = [${SES_MTA}]:587" \
"smtp_sasl_auth_enable = yes" \
"smtp_sasl_security_options = noanonymous" \
"smtp_sasl_password_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/sasl_passwd" \
"smtp_use_tls = yes" \
"smtp_tls_security_level = encrypt" \
"smtp_tls_note_starttls_offer = yes"
```
- It's slightly confusing to me that everything has the prefix `smtp` when in the `main.cf` file all I'm seeing is `smtpd`. I've looked into it and this question was helpful: https://serverfault.com/questions/696936/whats-the-difference-between-postfix-smtp-and-postfix-smtpd
- Basically, it seems like `smtpd` is the process that routes email that's delivered to the server to the appropriate location.
- And the `smtp` is the process that sends email out into the internet.
- Well, anyway, I ran that command above and it seemed to work without complaining. So...
- Now they want to me to setup a password or something using this command:
```sh
sudo vim /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
```
- Then paste in the following information:
```sh
[email-smtp.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com]:587 SMTP_USER:SMTP_PASSWORD
```
- So that's done now.
- Now they want me to secure the file using:
```sh
sudo chmod -v 0600 /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
```
- This is used to make sure even if someone makes it onto the backend of the server they can't do anything with your credentials in the file system.
-  I have to create the postfix hash map or whatever to make a database of credentials. I haven't done that yet, in fact, I'll probably just do it statically like ChatGPT recommends:
```sh
smtp_sasl_password_maps = static:<SMTP_USER>:<SMTP_PASSWORD>
```
## 10:00 - Creating SMTP credentials
- I had to create an SMTP credential on Amazon SES, which I did by clicking this button in SMTP settings:

- You get taken to this page to create the credentials:

- I created the credentials and put them into the `sasl_passwd` file.
