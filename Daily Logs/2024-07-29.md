## 20:06 - Fixing the Postfix stuff
- Okay, so I found a post on this stuff on [server fault](https://serverfault.com/questions/926071/in-postfix-whats-the-difference-between-myhostname-and-mydomain), and it seemed to say the hostname you use in your `main.conf` file should match the hostname of your actual site.
- I've changed the parameter `myhostname` so that now I have:
```sh
myhostname=mumie.health
```
- Okay this did something at least, it tried to send the email locally because my hostname is now mumie.health so when I attempt to send an email to mumie.health it directs it locally.
- Okay, so rather than send an email internally I added a new email to Amazon SES, by going to `Identities`

- Then clicking the Create identity button:

- And adding my `connor.jira@proton.me` email:

- This apparently works because when you're in Amazon SES sandbox mode you can't automatically send emails to anyone you like, the email address has to be verified by you on Amazon SES. As long as that is the case then you can send an email to it, otherwise you're getting bounced.
- This is basically to prevent email spamming and help AWS maintain their good reputation.

## 21:16 - How the email game works then
- So, what I've learned is the following, you have to change `myhostname` to your actual hostname so that when postfix is sending emails it users your hostname as the ending section.
- This is important because in Amazon SES you can setup verification of an entire hostname, which m:qeans even if postfix is sending stuff via the name `apache@mumie.health` (which is what it was doing) it will still go through Amazon SES correctly because it has the correct domain name.
- This is sort of silly really isn't it, because I could say that the email is coming from anywhere, but whatever. As in, I could totally make it up what the hostname is and connect to someone else's Amazon SES, but I guess I'd need the credentials etc. anyway, whatever, as I say.
- Then once you have that hostname and your domain verified on Amazon SES, you can proceed to send emails only to those email addresses you've verified if you're in sandbox mode.
- You also need to setup your postfix credentials, obviously, but that's a lot easier to find on the internet.
- And you also need to install postfix.
- The issue I was having was with identity verification on Amazon SES because I hadn't said that the email address I was trying to send to was verified.
- Now, I need to setup transport or something postfix so that I can send an email from tech@mumie.health to tech@mumie.health and change the admin email address.
- For more information on the rules you can read this: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/request-production-access.html

## 21:34 - Setting up transport rules on postfix
- So there's a file that postfix uses called `transport` and this is a human readable file that's held in the `/etc/postfix` directory. It contains maps from domains or emails to other locations, basically telling postfix how to direct mail around.
- So, I edited my transport file to include the following line:
```sh
mumie.health smtp:[email-smtp.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com]:587
```
- But then when I went to use this command:
```sh
sudo postmap transport
```
- I got the following error:
```sh
postmap: warning: /etc/postfix/dynamicmaps.cf: file is owned or writable by non-root users -- skipping this file
```
- You get this error because postfix doesn't want to use files that can be written by just anyone. This is because if a file can be written by anyone on a system it can be altered and your postfix configuration could be maliciously changed. Therefore, to avoid this, you have to set the ownership to the root user only and set permissions so that only they can edit it.
- Clearly `dynamicmaps.cf` matters for some reason in this instance. Anyway, now I've correct that, we should be all good when doing the transport stuff. And we are!
- Once the `postmap` command worked, I set the following parameter in `main.cf` file:
```sh
transport_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/transport
```
- and then restarted postfix:
```sh
sudo systemctl restart postfix
```
### Success!
After setting all of this up I have finally been able to change the administration email address to tech@mumie.health. Ideal!

## 21:51 - Investigating how to do no-reply emails on Amazon SES and getting approved.
- I guess now what I really need to do is get the email service on Amazon SES approved for use for mumie.health in general so we can email people.
- Here is the text I used to request we get our SES unlocked:
```txt
Overview:
We want to use Amazon SES to send transactional emails for a women's post-pregnancy health site. The product is at an early stage and only has emails for the following currently:

- Password resets
- Account confirmation emails
- Payment and subscription confirmations

Currently, we're sending about 20 emails a day, or 600 a month. As we grow over the next six months, we expect that number to remain under 10,000 monthly.

Building a mailing list:

We don't plan to build a mailing list in the traditional sense. The only emails we will send are transactional and caused by direct user interaction with our product.

Bounces and complaints:

We will handle bounces and complaints using Amazon SES's built-in notification system. We will configure Amazon SES to forward bounce and complaint notifications to an SNS (Simple Notification Service) topic. We will monitor and respond to this topic in real-time.

We'll adopt the following policies:
- Hard Bounces: We will immediately mark the affected email addresses as invalid in our database and stop sending emails to these addresses.
- Soft Bounces: We will implement a retry mechanism that attempts to resend the email a limited number of times before marking the email address as invalid.
- Complaints: Any email addresses associated with complaints will be flagged, and no further emails will be sent to these addresses.

Opting out:

Because all of our emails are transactional and important, there's currently no way to opt out of receiving them. However, if we expand to notification-style emails for account activity we will add opt-out buttons within the site in a user dashboard.
```
- Hopefully they look favorably on us!

## 22:25 - Last minute realisation
- I just remembered that because I've validated the entire `mumie.health` domain I can send emails to anyone on that domain and from anywhere in that domain.
- Therefore, I've changed my email from address to `no-reply@mumie.health`, and this works just fine! Yippee!
- I'm about 80% of the way there now, we still need to setup the SNS stuff with AWS and look after it all properly, but I don't think we're far from that now.
