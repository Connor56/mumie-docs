## 10:13 - Finishing Postfix, hopefully
- I've completed the following actions as well now:
```sh
sudo postmap hash:/etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
sudo chown root:root /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd.db
sudo chmod 0600 /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd.db sudo chown -R root:root /etc/postfix/
sudo chmod -R 655 /etc/postfix/
sudo systemctl restart postfix
```
- Well, this didn't work, I'm getting the following errors from postfix:
```sh

```
- Use can use the following command to list all the important parts of the postfix configuration file:
```sh
postconf -n
```

## 10:56 - Fixing some of the issues 
- I've spoken to chatgpt about it, and they're recommending I do several things. First among them is altering the `SES_MTA` variable to not have quotations around it, it seems that could be causing an issue!
- I've restarted postfix, time to see if that worked.
- Yep, I altered that one tiny thing, changing `SES_MTA` to:
```sh
SES_MTA=email-smtp.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com
```
- Now I'm making it through to Amazon SES, and it's complaining saying the following:
```sh
88EBBAAF6D5: to=<tech@mumie.health>, relay=email-smtp.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com[3.11.252.235]:587, delay=0.12, delays=0.01/0/0.03/0.09, dsn=5.0.0, status=bounced (host email-smtp.eu-west-2.amazonaws.est-2.amazonaws.com[3.11.252.235]:587, delay=0.12, delays=0.01/0/0.03/0.09, dsn=5.0.0, status=bounced (host email-smtp.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com[3.11.252.235] said: 554 Message rejected: Email address is not verified. The following identities failed the check in region EU-WEST-2: Mumie <hello@mumie.health>, apache@ip-172-31-18-180.eu-west-2.compute.internal (in reply to end of DATA command))
```
- So it's a bit complainy that my email address or something isn't verified. Hell yeah!
