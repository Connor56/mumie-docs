## 21:20 - Working on Email automation and paywall
- Next up on my list of things to do is working on the email automation side of things and the paywall so the marketing team can do their business and maybe we can make some money.
- The emails are basically set up, but it would be good to improve the email flow somehow so that people get a welcome email or something.
- I believe I've done this now with some changes I've made, but time to see if that has actually happened by testing sign up with my connor.jira account.
- I should delete the user from the app.mumie.health database and keep creating it to test and see.
- I need to complete the following things today:
	- [ ] Make sure an email is being sent when a new user signs up.
	- [ ] Setup the email so that it's required for you to click through there to complete setup or something.
	- [x] Check if there are users on the mumie.health site or not.
- There are only four users on the main site, that's me, laura, sarah, and team.

## 21:39 - Monster Analytics
- Monster Analytics is a plugin for WordPress that integrates Google analytics into your site and then presents information to you from the Google analytics platform.
- The free version shows you very little, but fortunately you can get all the information from the Analytics platform yourself.
- I probably need to set this up and do this so we can get around the tabs on Monster Analytics that don't work.

## 22:00 - User Registration Email
- I've updated the user registration feed to get them to activate their account via email:

- I'm going to test if this works now.
- Okay, this worked, but I get a really ugly webpage when I click through to say I'm activating my email:
![[Pasted image 20240806220531.png]]
- I wonder why this is?
- Anyway, if you sign up you can't log in by default anymore you get an email telling you you need to activate your account, which is better imo. I just need to figure out how to tell people to activate their account.
- Turns out there's a confirmation page that you can be sent to once the Gravity Form has completed. So when a new user signs up they go to the page listed in the confirmation and that page can give them a bit of extra information. This page now says they need to activate their account via email.
- Now I just need to figure out where the email text is being decided.

## 22:28 - Changing the automatic setup email
- Turns out you can alter the email that gets sent automatically on user activation in Gravity Forms. https://gravitywiz.com/customizing-the-user-activation-email-for-gravity-forms/
- I'm going to do this to say something nicer about Mumie and make it all a lot cleaner.
- You can also add something called a notification to the Gravity Form for User Registration, and this makes it possible to add a specific email with the text that you want rather than the dumb text you get from WordPress by default.

- This is much better.
- I was struggling though to try and make the email display the link in the way that I wanted. But then I found there was a visual mode and a text mode. The text mode seems to allow html to be used directly in the email and this was the key that showed me how I can setup the link in the email to be used directly!
- Beautiful.

- You can see the text option in the top right. Click that and you can setup your own `<a></a>` tags without anything else getting in the way!
- Also, after I had changed the login to require an email activation the system was still trying to log the user in immediately so the page saying what had happened wasn't being shown.
- I believe this is due to the `Theme My Login` plugin, which had this option:
![[Pasted image 20240806225804.png]]
- It was set to automatically log users in, but I turned it off. Now, hopefully, I'll be able to login correctly like I wanted to this whole time.
- There is definitely something about how all of this stuff works that makes me uneasy. I need to learn a lot more about WordPress/ PHP to become comfortable with using all of these plugins. They genuinely seem like big security risks tbh, fragile, breakable, not good really.

## 23:24 - User doesn't see confirmation screen
- The only thing that isn't working now is that the user isn't being taken to the confirmation page at all once they submit the gravity form.
- I'm not fully sure what that is, but it's pretty annoying. It could be something to do with the Theme My Login plugin still. Worth looking into deeper.
- I'm going to try switching off theme my login to see what happens.
- Okay, I turned it off, it did nothing that I could really see, so it clearly wasn't this that was the issue.
- I'll turn it back on in case it is actually needed, but I'm not sure it is, so I'll make a backlog item on jira to investigate this.
- Anyway, the issue appears to be you can't access that welcome page unless you're already a user which is clearly stupid, so I'll have to try and change that.
- You can see here in the address bar that it's trying to point at sign-up/welcome-to-mumie but with no success:
![[Pasted image 20240806233552.png]]
- Okay, I tried changing who owned the welcome page, changing it to no parent. This still didn't work, so clearly there's something else going on here.
- I guess I need to see why this stupid modal is being chucked up if that's the case.
- Maybe it's something that's actually in the theme or something like that? What a ballache that would be eh?
