## 22:05 - Email setup stuff
- I've been working to set up emails on Zoho in the admin area of AWS.

## 22:06 - Back to fixing sign up stuff
- Still need to fix the sign up stuff that's been going wrong, which means fixing stuff on the frontend so it doesn't look like we're charging anyone for anything.
- And then preventing the page that tells users they need to check their emails for validation from being behind the sign in.

## 22:59 - The sign up stuff won't let me through
- I want to direct the user to a welcome page after they've signed up but you need to be logged in to see it and I'm struggling to make the bloody thing let me through properly. #issue 
- One important thing to note, there's a page you get every time you try and access something without being logged in:

- This was confusing, because the page I was trying to load was CALLED `welcome-to-mumie` lol! But, anyway, I've found out that this page is shown no matter what url you try and access and it's coming from the `get_sidebar` function for some reason.
## 23:20 - Found the issue
- #fix-found I was using the incorrect type of page. The page that `welcome-to-mumie` needed was the `page.php`, whereas I was trying to set it to the `single-page.php`, which is basically the page we use for posts.
- This was causing an issue because on my Local deployment this has paywall stuff built into it now which of course the production site doesn't have yet.
- This was causing the production site to fail when I was trying to add this page.
- I swapped it to a `page.php` template, got rid of the need for sign in, and everything worked just fine.
- That should (hopefully) be our issues with sign ups handled.
