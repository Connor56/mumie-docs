## 09:39 - Roles in WordPress
- The next issue I'm having with WordPress now is the roles and how I can deliberately set them up to help me with marketing, and probably so that they can let through people to the welcome to mumie sign up page.
- It looks like these roles aren't typically at fault for this sort of thing and that it's more likely to be code inside of the `functions.php` file for the theme that's causing issues. I'll look into this now and see what's going on.
- Things I need to check according to ChatGPT:
	- [x] The `functions.php` file of the theme for custom code.
	- [ ] Potentially installing user role editor to see if Read can be added for specific pages.
	- [x] Theme template restrictions, any templates being used by the welcome page could have code in them that prevents them being read, investigate this.

## 10:55 - The source of Google Analytics duplicates
- I found one of the Google Analytics plugins inside of the theme for the `mumie.health` site. It was in the `html-header.php` file.
- It's probably the same in the other theme for `app.mumie.health` if this is an issue there too.

## 11:01 - Found the issue
- Turns out WordPress themes can setup pages that are used by different pages inside of WordPress. They follow a pattern searching for the correct page and if they can't find it they move on to generic pages.
- The generic page for `app.mumie.health` doesn't allow access to anyone on the page unless they're logged in, this is what's preventing the welcome message from being shown.
- I need to correct this by adding a new page that's specifically for the welcome page and using that for the page instead of the homepage or reminders or sign up or whatever page.
- You can see the specific pages here:

- Single page is what's being used for the welcome page, I need to alter this.

## 21:43 - Giving access to the google analytics to marketing
- For now, now florence is onboarded I need to give her access to the google analytics I've set up.
- I've altered the name of the Analytics account I'm using by going to the following page:

- There's an annoying left over test property that has itself with a line through it, I want it completely gone, it's so irritating:

- Going to figure out if I can get rid of it.
- Turns out you can't get rid of it, it's already in the bin and will be permanently deleted after 35 days. Irritating.
- Anyway next things next, adding more users to Google analytics.

## 22:14 - Adding Florence and Victoria to Google Analytics 
- I don't know whether I should add them as users to the property or to the account, or to particular views. But I'm thinking I should add each of them to the properties or something.
- I'm not sure what to add them as either but I'll look into that.
- ChatGPT seems to think giving access at the account level is best, because they need access to all the properties anyway. So here's how you do that:
![[Pasted image 20240807221915.png]]
- Click the admin button from the home of one of the properties.
- Click the account access management button:

- That then leads to the following screen where you can add an email and set role restrictions for the user you want to add:

- I've successfully added Victoria! Woohoo!

## 22:36 - What's left to do now
- Here are the things I have left to do from today:
	- [ ] Setup a new theme page for the welcome to mumie page that makes it accessible to users even if they're not logged in.
	- [ ] Remove the tags for the other google analytics page, and research why having more than one set of tags might be an issue.
	- [ ] Check the tags I'm removing are actually pointing to the location I think they are.

- Just completed some of the research piece now, it seems like the real negative side effect could be that data is double counted or events are fired more times than they should be. This is an issue and could result in bad metrics.
