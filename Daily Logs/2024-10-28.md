## 21:39 - Preparing
- Looking at this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWamixHIKmQ (too old)
- Maybe this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T96Pue6ePGA
- This tutorial could be the one: https://firebase.google.com/codelabs/firebase-auth-in-flutter-apps#2

## 22:09 - Rocking music
- Love this, hopefully google doesn't come down on me for it.
- Looks like I need to add a couple of files for this to work!
- Bit of an oversight from the google team. The app won't run without the `home.dart` file added already!
- Can customise the sign in page with your own images.
- Weird issue with the mumie logo not loading correctly even though it is in assets. #issue 
- I had to reload the app, presumably to put the assets into the compiled web app. #fix-found 

## 22:42 - Implementing home page
- #success Hell yeah, it wasn't that hard!
- Now to test it.
- eyyyy! I've managed to log in! Let's goooo!!
- Now adding google sign in.
- Doing this offscreen to avoid doxxing any important keys.
