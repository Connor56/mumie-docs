## 21:20 - Setting up the analytics for the site
- I'm currently looking into how to get analytics set up on the website and how to move my current web address over to

## 22:04 - Not sure how to combine Monster Insights and analytics
- I'm trying to figure out how to put together monster insights and google analytics, but it's not proving to be easy.
- I don't have the google analytics logins for one thing!
- Anyway, I'll find a way in the end.

## 22:56 - I already had Google Analytics
- For some reason I already had Google Analytics setup on my site. I've actually no idea how it happened tbh, maybe I installed it in some other way?
- Anyway, however it happened I'll try and figure it out.
- In other news, I have no successfully setup the Monster Insights plugin on the app.mumie.health and the mumie.health sites. Hopefully some interesting analytics being collected and coming through soon.
