## 6:58 - Researching where the other Google Analytics are coming from
- The other google analytics accounts are clearly getting data from somewhere, even though I'm not clear where that is.
- Therefore, I've set up a test property to see what code it wants me to add to get the tracking working.
- It's given me the following code:
  ```javascript
<!-- Google tag (gtag.js) -->
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-XZ978R72TB"></script>
<script> window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || []; function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);} gtag('js', new Date()); gtag('config', 'G-XZ978R72TB');
</script>
```
- So it's this that I need to be searching for in the themes to see if it's been manually set up.

## 7:14 - Email Issue
- It looks like there's an issue with the emails on the server. I can connect to the SMTP server, which is just PHP at this point, but nothing gets sent.
- This is something I'll have to look into pronto because it seems to be preventing new signs ups!
- The error in question is below:
![[Pasted image 20240723071538.png]]
- I need to sort this out to move forward with the website.
### Things I've tried
1. Changing the From Email from `hello@mumie.health` to `tech@mumie.health`. This didn't work I still got the same error.
2. I've tried moving to Amazon SES on the WP Mail SMTP plugin but insists you pay money to do this. I'm not going to do that so this doesn't work.

### Back to Bullets
- It looks like by default AWS blocks all traffic trying to come out on Port 25, which is the smtp port.
- I think I've found a way around the problem, I can install something called [postfix](https://www.postfix.org/), which is an open source mail provider apparently.
- Once I've got that installed I should be able to send emails using the PHP mail() function without issue.
- Or, at least, it's one part of the problem solved, I'll probably have to read a bit more about how it all works too.

## 19:17 - Getting postfix to work
- I'm going to work on Postfix only and see if I can get a simple email to send from the server.
- Once I've sorted that out, I'll try and get postfix to connect to Amazon SES so that I can get around the WP Mail SMTP bullshit block.

## 19:52 - Installing and running postfix
- I've installed postfix with the following command:
```sh
sudo dnf install postfix
```
- This command runs on the AL2023 instance type and installs postfix.
- When I run the test emails now I don't get any debug errors in WP SMTP like I used to. So I presume this part is running correctly.
- The emails still aren't being delivered though, so I guess maybe I have to run it just like `httpd`?
- I ran this command to start postfix as a service:
```sh
sudo systemctl start postfix
```
- And then this command afterwards to enable postfix to begin on startup of the instance:
```sh
sudo systemctl enable postfix
```
- Okay I've done this now, but it's still not sending mail, I'm going to have a look at the postfix logs and see if the mail is even reaching the postfix process.
- If it's not reaching the postfix process then I know I may not even need it and I probably need to look into how the `wp_mail()` function in PHP works.
- I tried sending an email to c.skelland@protonmail.com and I could tell it tried by running this function:
```sh
sudo systemctl status postfix
```
- This command produces a status of the running process and shows you the logs, really useful! I wonder if there's a way to make it real time to see the requests come through. You can see the log output here:
```sh
Jul 23 21:56:13 ip-172-31-18-180.eu-west-2.compute.internal postfix/cleanup[475942]: E823AAAF6FF: message-id=<QCc5wpJCP>
Jul 23 21:56:13 ip-172-31-18-180.eu-west-2.compute.internal postfix/qmgr[467728]: E823AAAF6FF: from=<apache@ip-172-31-1>
Jul 23 21:56:41 ip-172-31-18-180.eu-west-2.compute.internal postfix/smtp[475767]: connect to mail.protonmail.ch[176.119>
Jul 23 21:56:43 ip-172-31-18-180.eu-west-2.compute.internal postfix/smtp[475887]: connect to mail.protonmail.ch[185.70.>
```

- This is only part of it but you can see that it gets information from wordpress and then attempts to connect to the proton mail servers. Unfortunately, it basically can't connect, presumably because the port is blocked, I need to look into this now.
- It looks like it may not be possible to send out emails for port 25, which is the default port for postfix... I think. Instead you HAVE to connect to Amazon SES by relay, which can be done as per this article here: https://www.cloudpanel.io/tutorial/how-to-configure-amazon-ses-with-postfix/
- I'll check that out first thing tomorrow.

### Warning on exposing IP
- If I figure out how to let postfix send information I need to alter the name it sends information with because otherwise it will be sending emails out with the IP address of the server and apache as the user. This is a huge security risk and freebie for any potential hacker.
