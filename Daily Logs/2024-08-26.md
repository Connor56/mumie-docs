## 09:08 - Issue with adding ReCaptcha
- ReCaptcha can also not be added to the site because of the annoying 403 forbidden error going on with CloudFlare.
- I'm going to go directly to the website and set it up instead.
- Okay, by swapping the localhost and going into the backend I've made the changes that I need to make for now.
- This is also a potential workaround for the rest of the team whilst I sort out the paywall and google tags etc. before moving on to the backend to sort out all of our issues there, harden the tech and get ready for an actually large surge of people joining because of the marketing.
- I still need to use locust on a test setup on AWS to get to my first milestone and make it clear that I'm okay to use the site.
- To do this I should probably set up something like Ansible, or something along these lines to make the installation process simple with setting up the infrastructure with Terraform or cloud formation.
- The Captcha key is attached to my own Google Cloud Platform account:

- This might need to change in the future, but it's what we've got for now.
- It's very easy to add, you just have to add the add-on via Gravity forms, sign up for captcha, then input your site key and secret key. Bobs your uncle, fannys your aunt.
- And by default you *must* complete the captcha to complete sign up, so this should completely get rid of dumb fake accounts.
