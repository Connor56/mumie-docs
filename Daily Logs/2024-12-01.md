- Now I just need to:
	1. Build the full question and answer structure for them.
	2. Hook this up to the frontend so they have a set of answers they click through, and the UI updates with API calls.

- Stretch goals:
	1. Add the ability to pull articles from the database based on this and return text to the user.
