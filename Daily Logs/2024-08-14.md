## 23:27 - Not a whole lot done today
- Not a whole lot done today because of Rugby this evening. But I made some good progress on the paywall figuring out how to make a connection to the real database, update its data and extract everything.
- I should probably look into whether doing the directly database call is how it should be done in WordPress or whether there's a simpler way, but one thing at a time.
- Good news for now, I can access a table I've set up, push new data and read my old data!
