## 15:45 - Back to work
- I'm going to start working on Mumie again now.
- Usefulati is in a state where I can just make slow changes now and then and bump up the versions as I go.
- I'm sort of in a state where I'm deciding what works best in the visual and audio departments.
- Once I'm satisfied with the product and idea I'm going to send it to Casey Handmer and see what he thinks.
- In the meantime, I'm going to refocus my main efforts on Mumie and scaling that product, because it can also teach me everything I need to know about coding. I can use the same set of tools that we're using for esimgo and cloudnumbering and teach myself how it all works from the ground up.
- With that in mind, I want to use the following tools:
	1. GRPC Connect for protobuf communication: https://connectrpc.com/
	2. redis for caching: https://redis.io/
	3. lambda for functions: https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/
	4. maybe at some point kubernetes k8s: https://kubernetes.io/
	5. flutter for the application: https://flutter.dev/
	6. firebase for the user data: https://firebase.google.com/docs
