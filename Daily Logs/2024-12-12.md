## 15:45 - Back to work
- I'm going to start working on Mumie again now.
- Usefulati is in a state where I can just make slow changes now and then and bump up the versions as I go.
- I'm sort of in a state where I'm deciding what works best in the visual and audio departments.
- Once I'm satisfied with the product and idea I'm going to send it to Casey Handmer and see what he thinks.
- In the meantime, I'm going to refocus my main efforts on Mumie and scaling that product, because it can also teach me everything I need to know about coding. I can use the same set of tools that we're using for esimgo and cloudnumbering and teach myself how it all works from the ground up.
- With that in mind, I want to use the following tools:
	1. GRPC Connect for protobuf communication: https://connectrpc.com/
	2. redis for caching: https://redis.io/
	3. lambda for functions: https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/
	4. maybe at some point kubernetes k8s: https://kubernetes.io/
	5. flutter for the application: https://flutter.dev/
	6. firebase for the user data: https://firebase.google.com/docs
	7. Ent for the ORM connections: https://entgo.io/
	8. CDK for deployment: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/home.html
	9. In the end, I may need to go for the Terraform for Deployment: https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials

## 15:51 - What is the need for this product
- It's basically an app to help mum's MOT themselves after birth, what's going wrong, what's going right.
- We serve them information from a database that helps them understand what's going on with their body and directs them to helpful resources outside of Mumie etc.
- We centralise all the information in a single repository to make it very easy for Mum's to find the help they need and grow into their new role, or get back to who they want to be faster.
- We can do this with several paid add-ons. Say a simple workout tracker, or something along those lines that just gives people that little push they need and is tailored to help mum's understand what they need to do.
- The initial USP though is the articles and the MOT section of the app that have been pulled together by Laura.
- We need to capitalise on these articles and the following laura has built to grow the app.
