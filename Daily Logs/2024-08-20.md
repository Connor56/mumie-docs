## 08:50 - Florence and Victoria content meeting
- Florence and Victoria want more headers, more images, better presentation of content.
- Area to save your favourite blogs would be good.
- A leaderboard of some sort for the next blogs to recommend.
- Have your reminders constantly there as well, that adds more value.
- Florence gets annoyed when the features that she wants aren't immediately available in every place in the app, it annoys her having to switch context.
- It would be good to have notepad or highlights or something on the website to keep track of the points that you think are most important. That's a good premium feature.
- Curated snippets of information from a blog would be good.
- Kindle lets you highlight and bookmark.
