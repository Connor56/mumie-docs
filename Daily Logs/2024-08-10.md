## 08:16 - Making the local deployment
- My goal for this morning is to locally redeploy the site and write an article on the best way to do it.
- Then maybe I'll look at working on porting things around with git or something.
- Again, this is in: [[Local Deployment For Development]]

## 13:20 - Building the paywall
- I'm testing this out now in the good ol: [[The Free Paywall]] saga.
