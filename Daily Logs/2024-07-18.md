## 20:57 - Kneecapping the DNS
- Yes, it has basically come to it. I don't know if it's going to be okay to swap out the DNS, so I'm just going to do it and see.
- I've written a story on doing this. Whoopee!

## 22:24 - It seems to have worked
- I have successfully kneecapped Godaddy's DNS nameservers and pushed traffic to AWS. Geddon son.
- Things seem to have worked, we shall see what happens in the next couple of days.
- Next things next, I need to actually plan what I need to do, so here we go:
### My plan for the next couple of days
