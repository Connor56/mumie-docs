## 23:45 - Working on Flutter application
- I'm now working on a flutter application to demo to the Mumie team.
- I think this could be exactly what we're looking for and it will certainly be more fun making it.
- I'll see if the application from `o1-preview` works at all first.

## 23:57 - Yep the flutter app basically works
- Cool stuff tbh.

## 00:12 - Done with this
- Made an initial flutter app thing.
- I just need to figure out how to style it and I'll be good. Can't be that hard.
- Then I can get the question and answer stuff from WordPress and put it together on the flutter app.
