## 00:19 - App develop updates
- Started work on an AWS CDK project. Build the directory.
- Sent up the notes I've been making as docs to mumie-docs repository.
- Started working on the second page in the mumie app the question and answer page.
- All I need now is an AWS lambda function to basically contain all the gubbins for the questions and I'll be golden.
- Well I also need to figure out state, but yeah, very productive I think.

## 00:21 - Looking after Rommy now
- I'm going to continue the CDK tutorial for a bit to see how it goes.
- I've hard coded the env for my account now apparently with this:
```ts
#!/usr/bin/env node
import * as cdk from "aws-cdk-lib";
import { MumieCloudStack } from "../lib/mumie-cloud-stack";

const app = new cdk.App();
new MumieCloudStack(app, "MumieCloudStack", {
  /* If you don't specify 'env', this stack will be environment-agnostic.
   * Account/Region-dependent features and context lookups will not work,
   * but a single synthesized template can be deployed anywhere. */

  /* Uncomment the next line to specialize this stack for the AWS Account
   * and Region that are implied by the current CLI configuration. */

  /* Uncomment the next line if you know exactly what Account and Region you
   * want to deploy the stack to. */
  env: { account: "058264559523", region: "us-west-2" },

  /* For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/environments.html */
});
```
- One important thing to remember is that I've set up a profile called `mumie-admin` to use on the cli. If you don't specify the profile you want to use in a command it will look for the default profile, which in this case is empty, and fail immediately.
- So commands need to be run like this:
```sh
cdk boostrap --profile mumie-admin
```

## 00:26 - Rommy crying a lot going to pick him up
- But before I do, have a look at this gubbins:
```sh
 mumie-cloud git:(main) ✗ cdk bootstrap --profile mumie-admin
 ⏳  Bootstrapping environment aws://058264559523/us-west-2...
Trusted accounts for deployment: (none)
Trusted accounts for lookup: (none)
Using default execution policy of 'arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess'. Pass '--cloudformation-execution-policies' to customize.
CDKToolkit: creating CloudFormation changeset...
 ✅  Environment aws://058264559523/us-west-2 bootstrapped.
```
- ChatGPT says this is:
```
Basically this is making all the resources need to make a cloudformation stack that can be deployed.
```
