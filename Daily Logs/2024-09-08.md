## 09:24 - The Paywall write up is long
- Turns out I did a shit load of work on the Paywall and it's taking a long time to write up.
- Therefore, I'm moving on to the auto-deployment stuff now.

## 09:31 - Bot blocking
- I need to add the ability to block bots, 60% of our current traffic is from them. Not good!
- I've added this to goal three of Mumie.

## 09:34 - I'm going to do a stream for auto-deployment
- I'm going to stream me producing stuff in cloud formation, may as well do it for fun.
- Need to create the visuals for it though.
- Lol, I forgot that I already had a set up for this!
- Now I just need the WordPress architecture documentation from AWS loaded up, and I need a way to make this fun.
	1. How many attempts will it take me to create an architecture that works?
	2. How will I decide if it works or not?
	3. Maybe even me designing the actual architecture that I need or something?
	4. Recording how many times I fail to get it right.
	5. Recording how many times I have to ask ChatGPT for help.
	6. Recording how long it takes me to get a simple site up and running on my infrastructure.
	7. Recording how long it takes me to set up an Ansible playbook to build my architecture.

## 10:57 - Plan to do the build in stages
### Stage 1 - EC2 Only
#### Arch:
- Build an EC2 Instance.
- Build a detached IP Address.
- Build the security groups etc.
- Send the script from the terminal into Cloud Formation to build.
- Test this with ping checks.
- Build automatic and total removal of everything.
#### Software:
- Have WordPress installed via an Ansible playbook.
- Have the database installed via an Ansible playbook.
- Produce a bog standard WordPress site via Ansible playbook.
- Test by going to the IP Address built in the Arch.
#### DevOps:
- Turn the `wp-content` folder into a github repo.
- Add a step in the Ansible playbook for pulling the `wp-content` folder and creating a site.
- Pull repo locally, make some changes, push to GitHub and then pull using the Ansible playbook.
- Write some Python scripts that attempt to DDoS the server and crash it. To see what kind of performance different instances give you.
#### Just For Fun:
- If we get there, try and speed up the whole process of deployment.
- How fast can we make the deployment?
- Is it possible to do everything in under a minute?

### Stage 2 - EC2 + RDS
#### Arch:
- Build an EC2 Instance.
- Build a detached IP Address.
- Build an RDS instance for the database, simple, no failover, redundancy, etc.
- Build the security groups, in particular, lock down requests to RDS to come from EC2 only.
- Send the script from the terminal into Cloud Formation to build.
- Test this with ping checks.
- Build automatic and total removal of everything.
#### Software:
- Have WordPress installed via an Ansible playbook.
- Have the database installed via an Ansible playbook.
- Test by going to the IP Address built in the Arch.
#### DevOps:
- Add user data etc. to the site.
- Use Ansible to push that data into the RDS setup.
- Use Ansible to push the github repo of `wp-content`.
- Add some automated testing of the site using cypress or some other framework.
#### Just For Fun:
- If we get there, try and speed up the whole process of deployment.
- How fast can we make the deployment?
- Is it possible to do everything in under a minute?

### Stage 3 - EC2 + RDS (Hardcore)
#### Arch:
- Everything in stage 2.
- Add RDS in multiple availability zones.
- Add RDS failover.
- Add RDS snapshots for saving user data in case of failure.
- Add literally any other measures that will help data recovery.
- Add encryption, and GDPR compliant management.
#### Software:
- Have WordPress installed via an Ansible playbook.
- Have the database installed via an Ansible playbook.
- Test by going to the IP Address built in the Arch.
#### DevOps:
- Everything in Stage 2.
- Add some penetration testing for the RDS database.
- What are common techniques people use to get data, attempt these on the site to check it can withstand them.
- Add alerts so that I can be told when something is going wrong.
#### Just For Fun:
- If we get there, try and speed up the whole process of deployment.
- How fast can we make the deployment?
- Is it possible to do everything in under a minute?

### Stage 4 - EC2 (Hardcore) + RDS (Hardcore)
#### Arch:
- Everything in stage 3.
- Add an Amazon Machine Image representing the EC2 instance I would like to run.
- Automate the setup of the Amazon Machine Image somehow (Ansible?).
- Automate the deletion of Amazon Machine Images.
- Use the Amazon Machine Image in a load balancer setup that auto scales to match the load on the site.
#### Software:
- Figure out how to correctly load WordPress and other software bits and bobs into this setup.
- Once figured out, find a way of automating the process so it can be done at the click of a button.
#### DevOps:
- Everything in Stage 3.
- Simulate thousands of users accessing the WordPress site at any one time.
- Automate the gathering of data from AWS and show how that simulation affects site performance.
#### Just For Fun:
- If we get there, try and speed up the whole process of deployment.
- How fast can we make the deployment?
- Is it possible to do everything in under a minute?
